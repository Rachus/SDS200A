# Device data

During device-initialisation the SoftScope2-Software, which comes bundled with the device, queries two settings from the device.

## 0xc7 - read from eeprom
Structure:
|------------+---------------+----------+---------+--------+---------|
| Type       | bmRequestType | bRequest | wValue  | wIndex | wLength |
|------------+---------------+----------+---------+--------+---------|
| Control In | 0xc0          | 0xc7     | address | 0x0    |      64 |
|------------+---------------+----------+---------+--------+---------|

This seems to dump data form the eeprom at address `address`. The software requests the address-range `0x1c00` to `0x1f80` in 64 byte chunks.

The very regular structure of the read data hints that this data describes the devices calibration data. For more information on the device's calibration-settings, see [calibration](./calibration.md).

An example of the data transferred can be seen below:

```

That date was generated by the following code:
```python
def readEepromMemory(dev):
        eeprom = array.array('B', [])
        for i in range(0x1c00, 0x1f81, 64):
                mem = dev.ctrl_transfer(usb.util.build_request_type(usb.util.CTRL_IN, usb.util.CTRL_TYPE_VENDOR, usb.util.CTRL_RECIPIENT_DEVICE), 0xc7, i, 0, 64);
                eeprom += mem
        return eeprom
```

# 0xc5 - Unknown

Immediately after the Eeprom-memory has been read, "Softscope2" requests one additional byte. 
```

```

During our tests, the value transferred has always been `2`
