Schematics for the sds200a can be obtained from [www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid](http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid) - FCCID is `PO6SDS200A` (sorry, no direct linking possible, as the site tracks the referrer). `PO6` belongs into the field containing the Grantee Code and `SDS200A` into the field containing the product code. The PDFs can be found by clicking on "Detail" in one of the rows of the table of the next page.

The manufacturer provides a commercial SDK, even though the accompanying documentation is available freely from their [site's download section](http://www.softdsp.com/BIBoard/list.php?id=eng_download). It provides some information on the possible settings and features of the device.
However, most of this information should be available here by now.
