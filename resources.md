Semantics for the sds200a can be obtained from [www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid](http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid) - FCCID is `PO6SDS200A` (sorry, no direct linking possible, as the site tracks the referrer)

The manufacturer provides a commercial SDK ($360), even though the accompanying documentation is freely available from their [site's download section](http://www.softdsp.com/BIBoard/list.php?id=eng_download). It provides some informations on the possible settings and features of the device.
However, most of this information should be available here by now.
