Schematics for the sds200a can be obtained from [https://fccid.io/PO6SDS200A](https://fccid.io/PO6SDS200A).

The manufacturer provides a commercial SDK, even though the accompanying documentation is available freely from their [site's download section](http://www.softdsp.com/BIBoard/list.php?id=eng_download). It provides some information on the possible settings and features of the device.
However, most of this information should be available here by now.
